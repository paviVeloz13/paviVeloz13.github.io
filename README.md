*Big Data: A Very Short Introduction* by Dawn E. Holmes 

Have you heard "big data" being thrown left and right, hearing how important it is, but you don't which data they are talking about and if its so big, where they have it? Well this book is a great starting point. Dawn E. Holmes, a faculty from UC Santa Cruz, created this beginner introduction for those interested in the data analytics and data science fields, it provides a very United States centric perspective on Big Data. By the end of the book you will have plenty big data topics to research.

#### Hoy lo considero un éxito!
JULY 7, 2024

Hoy tuve una fiesta de tacos con mis amigas acá en corea. No había cocinado tacos en mas de un año. Sin embargo, los tacos estuvieron muy buenos la verdad. Aparte tuve una tarea que gracias a dios termine a tiempo. Tuve que pararme en un cafe a terminar una tarea pero la entregue a tiempo. Gracias a dios hoy fue un día estupendo. Siento que vivo en un sueño aca en corea haha.:)

#### What I learned about me today
MAY 19, 2024

Today I learned two things, that my body needs high stimulus everyday, and that my brain works like a computer.

May the stimulus be through binge eating, doing hw while caffeinated, talking with friends, or doing exercise, as long as I do a high exhilarating activity, then my brain can rest. It may seem like a curse at first, but when you think about it, it is also a superpower. I try to find an exhilarating way to live my everyday. May that be through my part time job where I teach STEM to kids and create different projects everyday, or by mastering a new programming skill in my data science class. Of course, rest is also important. I need lots of sleep, though seldom get to sleep lots.

I also learned I need to boot or warm-up my brain before doing a brain intensive task. I can’t start a difficult task off the bat just like so. If I want to do programming assignment, I have to drink coffee to have the brain juices flowing. Or else, my brain is just on energy-saving mode. It’s like I have two brain modes. On or off, 100% or nada.

#### 誰かこれを読んでんの？
MAY 13, 2024

誰かこれを読んでんの？今日でやったことで満足なの？満足やないの？大丈夫だよ。。。たまにただ存在すれば足りるはずだよ。毎日効率的はずじゃないよ。それより、体を大切してほしいよ。
またね。

#### 高血糖
APRIL 30, 2024

最近やった検査により僕の血におる砂糖レベルは高すぎます。だから、これからどのぐらい砂糖を取得することは気をつけます。例えば、先ブリットを食べたが食べきりませんでした。全て食べなくてよかったです。さらにあとジムに行こうと考えてます。

#### しなければいけないのは
APRIL 2, 2024

今はしないといけないのは今やている事です。あとでしないといけないことは今はしなくていい。なぜというと、将来のことを心配しいているなら、今しないといけないことに集中できません。
なので、後でしないといけないことは、後でしてもいいよ！。

#### 한국고
FEBRUARY 2, 2024

어제 한국고를 공부했어요.

#### 日本語を忘れないように
FEBRUARY 2, 2024

ま〜、このサイトで日本語ライティングを書いてみるかな。日本語はここまで頑張って、使うのはやめたら、時間の無駄やな。多分、今韓国語も学習をやっていますから、同じ風に韓国語ライティングをする。
じゃな〜

#### Why are you so afraid of failure?
JANUARY 29, 2024

When we fail at any given task, it only become a failure when we tell ourselves that that specific outcome equals failure. However, failure is should not bee seen in a negative connotation, because failure is the greatest teacher we have.
Only when we start looking at those failures as learning opportunities, we stop ourselves from the self-hate and we begin to appreciate the learning process.
One’s failure is another’s success

#### The higher the sacrifice, they higher the rewards
FEBRUARY 2, 2024

I’m typing this as I ponder on the good job I did the midterm I could about an hour ago or so. Just a week prior I was panicking on how to prepare for the stats midterm. By then, three weeks had passed and I still had no idea what was going on in class. However, because I wanted to do well, I did what I had avoided thus far, JUST STUDY HARD. Because my brain can’t really concentrate in many thing at a time, I allowed the week prior to the midterm just to the test. But because I know myself well, I moved my schedule accordingly, to where I was able to have long hours of uninterrupted studying. I learned that even just exposing myself to the material, even if I don’t get it at first, creates a sort of a subject or archive of the material. I realized this when learning Japanese and English, to learn the in and outs of a language, you need to expose yourself to as much input, even if you do not understand everything. Through this same thought process, I practice the class problems blindly, watched a ton of vides, until before I knew it, the material made sense.
I short, if you are anything like me, you will never understand the material in the first attempt, but you will definitely understand it on your 1000th attempt. I encourage you to find how many attempts it take YOU.
Now, do not ask me about reducing test anxiety; I auto-induced myself anxiety by drinking two cups of coffee before the exam.
